We have 2 folders: Items and Projects
For evey folder from above we have a subfolder for every group we want to create. These are the template types.
For every subfolder in the group we have a folder which contains the file(s) for the template and a manifest file (.template)
The manifest may have any name; the extension is .template. It will be the only file with this extension.
Manifest file contains some metadata only. All the files except the manifest will be added to the Solution/Project
