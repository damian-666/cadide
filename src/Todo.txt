Need to re-architect the tiers:
	1-Common
		- common interfaces and enums
	2-Data:
		- persisted documents: schematic, board, footprint, etc
	3-Services
		- where logic is defined
		- we have the compile and build
		- gerber generation
		- any output generation
	4-Presentation
		- ViewModels and Views
		- Controls
